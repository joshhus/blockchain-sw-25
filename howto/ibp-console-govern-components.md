After creating CAs, peers, and ordering nodes, you need to monitor the resources used by the nodes and potentially reallocate resources.
{:shortdesc}

**Target audience:** This topic is designed for network operators who are responsible for creating, monitoring, and managing their components in the blockchain network.

## Considerations when reallocating resources
{: #ibp-console-govern-components-reallocate-resources}

Resizing a node requires the containers to be rebuilt, which can cause a delay in the functioning of the node.
{:important}



Third party tools such as [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/secure-devops-platform/){: external} can be used to help monitor the usage in your cluster. If you determine that a worker node is running out of resources, you can add a new larger worker node to your cluster and then delete the existing working node.
{:note}


While it takes less effort to deploy enough resources to your Kubernetes cluster from the start and therefore be able deploy and expand resources without having to increase the resources in your cluster, the bigger the deployment, the more it will cost. Users need to consider their options carefully and recognize the tradeoffs that they are making regardless of the option that they choose.




You can scale your cluster by monitoring your nodes and following the instructions available from your cloud provider to add more nodes, larger nodes, or increasing the size of the nodes, depending on the options available in your cloud provider. The method you will use to increase storage will depend on the storage class you chose for your cluster. Note that if you are about to exhaust the storage on your peer or ordering node, you might need to deploy a new peer or ordering node with more storage and let it sync via your other components on the same channels.


Note that you do not need to adjust the CPU, memory, or storage for your smart contract pods. These pods will automatically use as many resources as they need to function efficiently. In cases where your smart contracts are struggling because of insufficient resources, you will have to address this at the cluster level.

## Deleting components
{: #ibp-console-govern-components-delete}
The best practice for deleting components is to delete them using the console. This will also delete all of the artifacts associated with a node including your ledger data in persistent storage and the keys that are stored as secrets. Deleting a peer will not, however, delete any smart contract pods associated with it. These must be deleted separately. Deleting a component is usually achieved by logging onto the console where a component was created or installed, clicking on the component and finding the related **trash can** icon. You will typically be prompted to type the name of the component and to confirm your decision. You can also delete nodes by using the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform APIs.

However, there are cases in which this type of deletion will not be successful. For example, occasionally when a node fails to deploy it will not be possible to delete it using the console. The same can be true if the console loses connection with the cluster for some reason.

In these cases, it will be necessary to delete the node or relevant pods manually. Your Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} manager of choice might have a UI that allows you to delete pods. Check the documentation for your cluster for instructions.

Because smart contracts installed on a 2.x peer are deployed into their own pods and not directly into the peer container, they will not be deleted when a peer is deleted. They will have to be deleted either using the UI of your cluster or by issuing kubectl commands. Smart contracts installed on a v1.4.x peer will be deleted when the peer is deleted.
{: important}


If you are using OpenShift, you have the option to use either the kubectl CLI (which is native to Kubernetes), or the OpenShift cluster (oc) CLI. The commands should be largely the same, except that OpenShift uses "projects" instead of "namespaces". If you are running any cluster type other than OpenShift, you will have to use the kubectl CLI. In this topic, we'll use both CLIs.
{: tip}




If you want to delete all of your smart contract pods, you can issue this command:




```
kubectl get po -n <PROJECT_NAME> | grep chaincode-execution | cut -d" " -f1 | xargs -I {} kubectl delete po {} -n <PROJECT_NAME>
```
{:codeblock}

Where `<PROJECT_NAME>` is the name of your OpenShift project.


If you want to delete a single smart contract pod, you will first have to figure out the name of your smart contract pod.




First, get a list of all of the smart contract pods running in your cluster:

```
kubectl get po -n <PROJECT_NAME> | grep chaincode-execution | cut -d" " -f1 | xargs -I {} kubectl get po {} -n <PROJECT_NAME> --show-labels
```

You should see results similar to:

```
NAME                                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
chaincode-execution-0a8fb504-78e2-4d50-a614-e95fb7e7c8f4   1/1     Running   0          14s   chaincode-id=javacc-1.1,peer-id=org1peer1
NAME                                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
chaincode-execution-f3cc736f-94ef-454d-8da3-362a50c653d9   1/1     Running   0          4m    chaincode-id=nodecc-1.1,peer-id=org1peer1
```

Your smart contract name and version is visible next to the chaincode-id.





To delete a single pod, issue this command, substituting the `<POD_NAME>` for the name of your pod, for example the smart contract pod `chaincode-execution-0a8fb504-78e2-4d50-a614-e95fb7e7c8f4`, as well as your `<PROJECT_NAME>`:

```
oc delete pod <POD_NAME> -n <PROJECT_NAME>
```
{:codeblock}





If you cannot use your console or the APIs to remove your nodes, you can manually remove all of the nodes from your cluster by using the OpenShift CLI. Navigate to your OpenShift Project:

```
oc project <PROJECT_NAME>
```
{:codeblock}


Then run the following commands to delete all of your blockchain nodes:

```
kubectl delete ibpca --all
kubectl delete ibppeer --all
kubectl delete ibporderer --all
```
{:codeblock}

You may also choose to only delete all of a single type of node within a namespace, for example, by only issuing `kubectl delete ibppeer --all`.

Note that if you delete your entire project, your smart contract pods will also be deleted.
